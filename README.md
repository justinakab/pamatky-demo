<h2>Czechitas Digital Academy final project:</h2>
<h1>Pražské Památky / Prague Monuments</h1>
<p>This project represents the final achievement of our front-end web course at Digital Academy Czechitas.  Our goal was to create an interactive web guide to Prague's landmarks, specifically designed for children aged 10 and above.
</p>
<p>The aim of our initiative is not only to bring the rich history of Prague to younger generations but also to offer an innovative and fun way to learn about the architecture and cultural heritage of this city. At the same time, we emphasized the visual aspect, as we want to present this project in the future. We are also aware that illustrations and photographs will provide a visually engaging experience for children. 
</p>

<p>We are also committed to expanding the boundaries of conventional academic projects and trying out new functionalities. For example, we have implemented elements beyond the standard Digital Academy framework - a drag-and-drop feature. And we've also taken charge of all the design of the sights!
